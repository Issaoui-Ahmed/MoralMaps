# User Data JSON Structure

Each participant's progress is persisted as a single JSON document stored under the key `user-data:<sessionId>`. The document captures the scenarios that were shown to the participant, their routing decisions, and their responses to the post-experience survey.

## Top-level fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `sessionId` | `string` | Unique identifier assigned to the participant when the session starts. |
| `createdAt` | ISO timestamp | When the session record was created. |
| `lastUpdatedAt` | ISO timestamp | When any part of the session record was last updated. |
| `totalScenarios` | `number` | How many scenarios were scheduled for the participant. |
| `scenarios` | `ScenarioEntry[]` | Ordered list describing each presented scenario and the participant's choice. Empty slots may be `null` if the user did not reach that scenario. |
| `surveyResponses` | `object` | Normalized answers submitted via the survey form. Only present after completion. |
| `completedAt` | ISO timestamp (optional) | Set once the survey is submitted. |

## Scenario entries

Each element of `scenarios` is an object with the following shape:

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `index` | `number` | Zero-based position of the scenario in the flow. |
| `presentedAt` | ISO timestamp | When the scenario was first presented (captured when the choice was logged). |
| `details` | `object` | Snapshot of the scenario content that was rendered for the participant (start/end points, default travel time, alternatives, etc.). |
| `choice` | `object` | Metadata describing the participant's selection for this scenario. |

The `details` object contains the same fields that were delivered to the client (scenario name, `start`, `end`, `defaultTime`, `alternatives`, etc.). Undefined values are omitted.

The `choice` object includes:

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `label` | `string` | Identifier for the selected route ("default" or the alternative's label). |
| `routeIndex` | `number` | Index of the selection (0 for default, `n` for the nth alternative). |
| `isDefault` | `boolean` | Convenience flag indicating whether the default route was chosen. |
| `defaultTime` | `number` | Default route travel time in minutes. |
| `tts` | `number` | Delta in minutes relative to the default route for the chosen alternative. Zero for the default route. |
| `totalTimeMinutes` | `number` | Travel time of the selected route (`defaultTime + tts`). |
| `recordedAt` | ISO timestamp | When the choice was submitted. |
| `selectedAlternative` | `object \| null` | Snapshot of the chosen alternative from `details.alternatives`. Only present when an alternative route was selected. |
